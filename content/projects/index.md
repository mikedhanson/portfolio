Here's a list of some of the open source projects I've worked on:

# ChocolateyManager

I was tired of manually running chocolatey updates and wanted a more automated way for my updates to just happen in the background. If you are interested in automating your software updates, have a look at the repo. 

If you run the update script from windows task scheduler you will get a nice toast message when your updater runs.

# Graycord

### Why? 

Graylog does a good job as a standalone syslog server but I found a shortcoming where it wasnâ€™t able to send alerts to discord. So, I took on the challenge to dive into python3 and learn all about docker.

### How does it work? 

The script loops on an interval doing api calls to graylog checking for the SEARCH_QUERY that you provide. For example you can specify any search query that you can make through graylog and get that data back to whatever discord CHANNEL you choose.

# Unraid - Rclone Backup

### How does it work? And why?

Following the 3-2-1 backup [strategy](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) and hosting an undraid server I wanted an automated way to backup core files and folders on my unraid server all while encrypting the offsite data. The solution to this was rclone. I was able to write some scripts the uses rclone to do all of this. This solution encorperates logging and alerts in unraid which get sent to a discord server.
