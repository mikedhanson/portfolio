Hi there 👋

I recently took a new position with the State of South Dakota as an Endpoint Architect with the Service Delivery team. In my free time I spend a lot of time managing and changing up my home network. Between building my own docker images to controlling IOT things around the house to self-hosting my own react portfolio, it keeps me quite busy.

I am passionate about technology and tinkering with hardware. I enjoy coffee more than I should and like to spend time outdoors either camping or on the water.
